# Institute Website Sample

This is a sample institute website featuring dynamic content such as courses, achievers, and a director's column. The site also includes a seamless carousel feature to enhance the user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you need to have **Daytona** installed. Daytona helps you run cloud-based containers without setting up the environment locally.

### Installation & Running via Daytona

1. **Install Daytona**  
   Follow the [Daytona installation guide](https://daytona.io/docs/installation) to install Daytona.

2. **Create a Workspace**  
   Once Daytona is installed, open your terminal and start the server with the following command:

   ```bash
   daytona serve
   ```

   This will start a daemon server and a cloud container where you can test your application without setting it up locally.

3. **Create the Project Workspace**  
   To set up this application, use the following command:

   ```bash
   daytona create https://github.com/Prince94201/target.git
   ```

   This will pull the sample project repository and set up the container for you.

4. **Access the Application**  
   Once the project setup is complete, open your web browser and visit:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

   This will open the live instance of the website where you can see the sample content and interactive features.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
  
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.
  
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for best performance and minifies the app.

- `npm run eject`: Ejects the build tool and configuration, giving you full control over them.
